    <h1> How does <b>SEXISM</b> affect people? </h1>
  Everyday women face instances of sexism in schoool and work; in public and private. <br><br>
  
  Here are some of their stories: 
  
  "“He asked to speak to the manager, so I told him that was me.”
The first time I remember was when I was a 21-year-old theatre box office manager of a prestigious theatre in Toronto. A male customer argued with our policy that I had explained to him. He asked to speak to the manager, so I told him that was me.

Just then, our newest, youngest, male employee walked behind me, and the customer asked to speak to him. Since we had a ticket booth window, I was able to stand to the side, not being seen or heard by the customer, and tell the younger, new, male employee what to say in answer to the questions. The customer accepted his answers/explanations and walked away.
